I am a student interested in web development from Turkey. I'm starting my journey in web development, beginning with fundamental technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Simultaneously, I'm exploring modern tools like TypeScript and React, which are shedding light on my path. I've also taken my first steps into server-side development with Node.js. My goal is to create user-friendly interfaces and design powerful, scalable backend systems. In the future, I aspire to make a difference as a full-stack developer. I'm learning something new every day and striving towards my goal with confidence.
